# Dice

## A game of dice

Alice proposes a game to Bob.

On the table are 3 dice with 6 sides each, and labels of the numbers 1 through 18. Player X gets to arrange the labels on the dice, after which player Y gets the first pick.

In each of the ten rounds that follow, each player will cast their die. The player with the highest roll wins the round. The player who wins most rounds wins the game.

Should Bob be player X or player Y?

## Solution

### Conditions under which Bob volunteers to be player X

Player X only has an advantage if she can choose a die that beats player Y's pick regardless of Y's pick.

Such a property that may colloquially be referred to as a Rock-Paper-Scissors property. For Rock-Paper-Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper, and Rock beats Scissors. Knowing what your opponent chooses therefore ties up the win. Mathematicians refer to this property as nontransitive, or intransitive.

Bob should only choose to be player X if he is able to arrange the labels on the dice such that die A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. We say A beats B if A results in a higher roll than B more than half the time.

### Solutions

It comes as a surprise to many that a nontransitive configuration is not just possible, but 10,705 solutions exist. Twenty of these are presented below.

### Ranking the solutions

Even though constructing a nontransitive set gives Bob an advantage, some nontransitive sets are preferable over others.

Consider first that Alice is likely aware of the crux of the problem and will pick the die that gives Bob the least advantage. Bob therefore prefers solutions that ensure that the least of the three dominance relations is as high as possible. For the top 15 solutions this probability equals 21/36, or 0.5834.

Consider also that Alice may assume Bob has an edge, and that his edge is the same regardless of which die she chooses. Note that the top 7 solutions include one die that is beaten by a much larger number. Alice may inadvertently choose this die, so it is in Bob's interest for this wildcard choice to be as advantageous as possible.

### Bob's chances of winning

Bob chooses solution 1. How likely is he to win?

## Problem history

Nontransitive dice were popularized by Martin Gardner in his Scientific American column [1]. The problem described above is similar to the problem outlined in the introduction of a paper by Savage [2].
